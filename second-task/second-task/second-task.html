            <h3>GDPR and ZOHO</h3>
            <p>The General Data Production Regulation(GDPR) is a data privacy regulation that aims to give individuals better<br> protection,control,and awareness of how their information is used,processed,or dispossed.</p>
            <p class="text2">Zoho,as a company and by its philosophy,has always believed in safeguarding customer data and ensuring its<br> privacy,no matter where they're located.Zoho Backstage,by extension,has been actually designed to help you<br> process the large amount of attendee data collected by you during an event in compilance to the GDPR.If you're a <br>business running your events in the EU,the GDPR is applicable while you handling attendee data.</p>

            <p class="text2">Of all the others,the event industry is especially known to accumulate data from various sources and tools.In fact,<br>one of the reasons the GDPR is in force is because of the rate at which data is being used-rather,misused-by<br>organizations today.Well it's not surprising to us,and that's why we've carefully made every feature in your event<br>management software GDPR complaint-so:</p>
